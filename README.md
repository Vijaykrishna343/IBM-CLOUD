Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance model for industrial machines to anticipate failures before they occur. By analyzing real-time and historical sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure, voltage, rotational speed, etc.), the system predicts potential failures like tool wear, heat dissipation issues, or power failure. This proactive approach reduces downtime, lowers maintenance costs, and increases equipment lifespan.

Proposed Solution
Data Collection: Historical + real-time sensor data, usage logs, maintenance history.

Preprocessing: Handle missing values, reduce noise, feature engineering (rolling averages, lagged features, trends).

Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest

XGBoost

LSTM (for sequential data)

Deployment: IBM Cloud Lite + Watsonx.ai Studio with real-time dashboards and failure alerts.

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.

 Tech Stack
Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud Lite

Tools & Libraries: IBM Watsonx.ai Studio, Runtime

Algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM

 System Workflow
