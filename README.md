Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

 Introduction
Industrial machines are the backbone of modern industries. However, unexpected breakdowns can cause:
•	🚨 Downtime → production stops
•	💸 High Maintenance Costs → emergency repairs
•	📉 Reduced Efficiency → lower output & delays
Traditional maintenance strategies are either:
•	Reactive: Fix the machine after it fails.
•	Preventive: Service machines on a schedule, even if they don’t need it
•	 Both methods are costly and inefficient.

✅ Solution: Predictive Maintenance
This project builds a Predictive Maintenance System using Machine Learning + Real-Time Sensor Data.
It predicts failures before they happen, so industries can:
•	Repair only when needed.
•	Reduce downtime.
•	Extend equipment lifespan.

Problem Statement
How can we predict industrial machine failures in advance using sensor data?
We aim to:
•	Analyze historical + real-time data (temperature, vibration, voltage, pressure, etc.).
•	Build ML models that classify failures:
o	🛠️ Tool Wear
o	🔥 Overheating
o	⚡ Power Failure
•	Provide real-time alerts to maintenance teams.

 Proposed Solution
🔹 Step 1: Data Collection
•	Collect historical sensor readings (temperature, vibration, rotational speed, etc.).
•	Gather real-time data streams + contextual data (usage logs, maintenance history).
🔹 Step 2: Data Preprocessing
•	Handle missing values and noise.
•	Detect and remove outliers.
•	Create new features → rolling averages, lagged values, trends.
🔹 Step 3: Machine Learning Models
We experiment with different ML models:
•	Random Forest → Interpretable and robust.
•	XGBoost → High accuracy for tabular data.
•	LSTM → Handles time-series sensor data effectively.
🔹 Step 4: Deployment
•	Hosted on IBM Cloud Lite using Watsonx.ai Studio.
•	Real-time dashboards with alerts.
•	Scalable and secure architecture.
🔹 Step 5: Evaluation
•	Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.
•	Continuous monitoring + retraining with new data.
