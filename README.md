 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Industrial machines are critical to manufacturing and production industries, but unexpected failures often result in high maintenance costs, unplanned downtime, and production delays.

This project introduces a Predictive Maintenance Model that uses sensor data and machine learning techniques to anticipate failures before they occur. By analyzing real-time and historical machine data, the system can detect patterns that precede equipment breakdowns.

Key Benefits:

* Early failure detection prevents costly breakdowns.
* Proactive maintenance reduces repair frequency and costs.
* Extended machine lifespan through better utilization.
* Improved operational efficiency by minimizing downtime.



 PROBLEM STATEMENT

The challenge lies in predicting industrial machine failures ahead of time using data-driven approaches.

The project aims to:

* Analyze sensor data from machinery (temperature, vibration, pressure, voltage, rotation speed).
* Build a classification model to predict failure types (tool wear, heat dissipation, power failure).
* Provide real-time alerts for maintenance teams.
* Reduce downtime and operational costs through preventive action.



 PROPOSED SOLUTION

The system integrates data collection, preprocessing, machine learning, and cloud deployment to deliver accurate predictions and real-time monitoring.

 Data Collection

* Gather historical machine data such as sensor readings, machine usage logs, maintenance records, and environmental factors.
* Integrate real-time sensor streams for live monitoring.

Data Preprocessing

* Handle missing values, noise, and outliers.
* Apply feature engineering such as rolling averages, lag features, and statistical measures to uncover hidden patterns.

 Machine Learning Algorithm

* Random Forest: Robust and interpretable, suitable for tabular data.
* XGBoost: High accuracy and efficiency with gradient boosting.
* LSTM: Captures sequential dependencies in time-series sensor readings.
* Incorporate contextual factors such as machine age, time of day, and maintenance cycles.

 Deployment

* Develop a dashboard for predictions and failure alerts.
* Deploy on IBM Cloud Lite using Watsonx.ai Studio for scalability.
